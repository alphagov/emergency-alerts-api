# GOV.UK Emergency Alerts API

Contains:
- the public-facing REST API for GOV.UK Emergency Alerts, which teams can integrate with using [our clients](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation)
- an internal-only REST API built using Flask to manage services, users, templates, etc (this is what the [admin app](http://github.com/alphagov/emergency-alerts-admin) talks to)
- asynchronous workers built using Celery to put things on queues and read them off to be processed, sent to providers, updated, etc

## Setting Up

### Python version

We run python 3.9 both locally and in production.

### psycopg2

[Follow these instructions on Mac M1 machines](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1216#issuecomment-1068150544).

### AWS credentials

To run the API you will need appropriate AWS credentials. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-manuals/wiki/aws-accounts#how-to-set-up-local-development) for more details.

### Pre-commit

- If `pre-commit` and `tflint` are not already installed on your machine, run
`brew install pre-commit` and 
`brew install tflint`

- In this repositoryâ€™s folder, run
`pre-commit install` and 
`pre-commit install-hooks`

### `environment.sh`

Creating and edit an environment.sh file.

```
echo "
export NOTIFY_ENVIRONMENT='development'
export ENVIRONMENT='development'

export FLASK_APP=application.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=False
export WERKZEUG_DEBUG_PIN=off

export RDS_HOST='localhost'
export RDS_PORT=5432
export RDS_USER='eas-user'
export RDS_REGION='eu-west-2'
"> environment.sh
```

## Running the Admin and Api services with Postgres

Please refer to the README in the /emergency-alerts-tooling repository, in the /emergency-alerts-tooling/compose folder.


## THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE DEPRECATED AND SHOULD BE USED FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY
(This section will be removed in the future, as the Emergency Alerts app is fully decoupled from Notify)

### Postgres

Install [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/).

Currently the API works with PostgreSQL 11. After installation, open the Postgres app, open the sidebar, and update or replace the default server with a compatible version.

**Note:** you may need to add the following directory to your PATH in order to bootstrap the app.

```
export PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/11/bin/
```

### Redis

To switch redis on you'll need to install it locally. On a Mac you can do:

```
# assuming you use Homebrew
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

To use redis caching you need to switch it on with an environment variable:

```
export REDIS_ENABLED=1
```

### Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that committed code meets basic standards for formatting, and will make basic fixes for you to save time and aggravation.

Install pre-commit system-wide with, eg `brew install pre-commit`. Then, install the hooks in this repository with `pre-commit install --install-hooks`.

##  To run the application

```
# install dependencies, etc.
make bootstrap

# run the web app
make run-flask

# run the background tasks
make run-celery

# run scheduled tasks (optional)
make run-celery-beat
```

We've had problems running Celery locally due to one of its dependencies: pycurl. Due to the complexity of the issue, we also support running Celery via Docker:

```
# install dependencies, etc.
make bootstrap-with-docker

# run the background tasks
make run-celery-with-docker

# run scheduled tasks
make run-celery-beat-with-docker
```

##  To test the application

```
# install dependencies, etc.
make bootstrap

make test
```

## To run one off tasks

Tasks are run through the `flask` command - run `flask --help` for more information. There are two sections we need to
care about: `flask db` contains alembic migration commands, and `flask command` contains all of our custom commands. For
example, to purge all dynamically generated functional test data, do the following:

Locally
```
flask command purge_functional_test_data -u <functional tests user name prefix>
```

On the server
```
cf run-task notify-api "flask command purge_functional_test_data -u <functional tests user name prefix>"
```

All commands and command options have a --help command if you need more information.
